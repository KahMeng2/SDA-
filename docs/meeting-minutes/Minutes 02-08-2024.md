## Agenda Items
### 1. Discussion of application domain
**Discussion points**
- Came to a shared understanding of the requirements based on the application domain description, eliminated misconceptions
- Decided not to implement memberships for simplicity
- Discussed project scope - whether to implement the system realistically or just do the bare minimum to be able to demo the user stories

**Decision/Action Items:**
- Made an ed post to clarify project scope

### 2. Creation of domain diagram
**Discussion:**
- Incrementally built up the domain diagram together, first defining a list of classes, then fields, then multiplicities
